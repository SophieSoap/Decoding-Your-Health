					<h2>Evaluating</h2>
        			<h1>Samsung Health</h1>
				</div>
				<div class="step" data-step="2">
					<h2>Access Point</h2>
					<section class="text-box">
						<p>Samsung Health offers several access points into the app. Besides the usual App Icon, Samsung Health also offers <span class="green-text">several widgets</span> that can be placed on the home screen. Besides Sleep and a general overview you can also track your steps this way.</p>
					</section>
				</div>
				<div class="step" data-step="3">
					<section class="text-box">
					<p>Those Widgets can help you to <span class="green-text">access the app more quickly</span> (1) and provide you with quick and intuitive overviews every time you unlock your phone.</p>
				</section>
				</div>
				<div class="step" data-step="4">
					<section class="text-box">
						<p>It is important to note that while home screen widgets initially <span class="green-text">enhance user engagement</span> they often face declining usage over time due to <span class="pink-text">novelty wear-off</span> and evolving user habits. To circumvent this issue Samsung Health also employs frequent notifications to keep you using the app and remind you of your progress.
						</br></br>
						They serve as a <span class="green-text">more active reminder</span>, re-engaging you with the app, but they also have the potential to become intrusive. When notifications shift from gentle encouragement to an enforcement of daily goals, they may <span class="pink-text">add pressure and disrupt daily life</span> rather than fostering a balanced approach to health (2).</p>
					</section>
				</div>
				<div class="step" data-step="5">
					<section class="text-box">
						<p>Depending on the relationship you have with your body and health, these features can have vastly different consequences.</br>
						</br> Getting frequent reminders can help to <span class="green-text">keep you motivated</span> (3) as well as up to date with your progress without having to open the app. </br>
						</br> However, focusing too much on numerical goals can lead to <span class="pink-text">obsessive behaviours</span> as well as <span class="pink-text">frustration</span>, when step targets are missed. This constant reminder of incompletion can evoke guilt and, over time, contribute to <span class="pink-text">anxiety, disordered eating, or unhealthy exercise habits</span>. (4)(5)</p>
					</section>
				</div>
				<div class="step" data-step="6">
					<h2>Micro-interactions</h2>
					<section class="text-box">
						<p>Samsung Health heavily utilised animations, tool tips and other micro-interactions to get your attention. Especially animations are used almost everywhere, sometimes to <span class="green-text">point your attention</span> in a specific direction, other times to <span class="green-text">reward</span> you for reaching certain goals. When you fulfil your step goal, for example, you might get a little confetti animation. This releases dopamine, reinforcing your tracking behaviours and <span class="green-text">encouraging consistent engagement</span>.</p>
					</section>
				</div>
				<div class="step" data-step="7">
					<section class="text-box">
						<p></br>They also help to shift your attention to the most prominent information, making the content shown <span class="green-text">less overwhelming</span> and easier to follow.</p>
					</section>
				</div>
				<div class="step" data-step="8">
					<section class="text-box">
						<p>Colour is also used to fulfil the same reward function. Samsung Health’s UI is very simple and clean but utilises a lot of vibrant colours. Highlighted progress bars make tracking <span class="green-text">easy to understand</span>, while micro-interactions—such as dynamic bar charts rising with progress and celebratory confetti animations—add a rewarding element.</p>
					</section>
				</div>
				<div class="step" data-step="9">
					<h2>Health Benefits</h2>
					<section class="text-box">
						<p>Samsung Health provides objective health data, enabling you to track progress in fitness, sleep, and nutrition. This information can <span class="pink-text">help you identify patterns</span>, address health concerns, and make informed lifestyle adjustments.</br></br>
							However, merely logging in steps or sleep hours does not guarantee meaningful improvements. Without actively responding to insights, tracking can create an <span class="pink-text">illusion of progress</span> without tangible health benefits (2).</p>
					</section>
				</div>
				<div class="step" data-step="10">
					<h2>Sense of Control</h2>
					<section class="text-box">
						<p>Tracking health metrics through Samsung Health gives you a sense of control over your fitness. A study in the Journal of Medical Internet Research found that 83% of fitness tracker users reported <span class="green-text">feeling more in control of their health</span> (6). However this feeling <span class="pink-text">doesn’t always reflect real improvement</span>. The app allows for customisation of health goals, making tracking a personalised experience, that enhances motivation.</p>
					</section>
				</div>
				<div class="step" data-step="11">
					<section class="text-box">
						<p>This sense of control can also turn into over-reliance on data. When numbers take precedence over bodily intuition, you may ignore signals like hunger, fatigue, or stress in favour of meeting an arbitrary metric. This phenomenon, known as data fetishism, can lead to <span class="pink-text">poor health decisions</span>, such as restricting food intake based on inaccurate calorie tracking or pushing through workouts despite exhaustion (7).</p>
					</section>
				</div>
				<div class="step" data-step="12">
					<h2>Social Engagement</h2>
					<section class="text-box">
						<p>Samsung Health fosters social motivation through its "Together" feature, allowing you to <span class="pink-text">connect with other users</span> and participate in challenges: 
						</br></br>Goal-Oriented Challenges: Set your personal targets.
						</br></br>Team Challenges: Groups of up to 254 people collaborate or compete toward shared goals.</p>
					</section>
				</div>
				<div class="step" data-step="13">
					<section class="text-box">
						<p>Global Challenges: Monthly competitions with up to 800,000 participants worldwide.
						</br></br>These features create a sense of <span class="green-text">accountability and camaraderie</span>, motivating you to stay active (8). However, competition can sometimes foster unhealthy exercise habits. The pressure to outperform others may lead to <span class="pink-text">overexertion, stress, or disappointment</span>, when failing to match peer-based goals (7).</p>
					</section>
				</div>
				<div class="step" data-step="14">
					<h2>Chronic Illness Management</h2>
					<section class="text-box">
						<p>If you’re managing chronic conditions, Samsung Health simplifies symptom tracking, medication reminders, and lifestyle monitoring. The app integrates with devices, like blood glucose and blood pressure meters, <span class="green-text">consolidating essential health information</span> in one place (9).
						</br></br>While this centralised tracking is beneficial, it can also become <span class="pink-text">overwhelming</span>. The constant need to log symptoms and check metrics may feel like an additional burden, transforming health tracking from a helpful tool into a source of stress (10).</p>
					</section>
				</div>
				<div class="step" data-step="15">
					<h2>Tracking as a Habit</h2>
					<section class="text-box">
						<p>What starts as a helpful tool for motivation can eventually feel like an obligation. The home screen widget constantly reminds you to track your activity, which can be beneficial—but over time, it may turn into a <span class="pink-text">source of pressure</span>. Self-tracking requires ongoing effort, and the obligation to monitor every detail of your health may detract from other aspects of life, making tracking <span class="pink-text">feel like a chore</span>, rather than an empowering habit (7).</p>
					</section>
				</div>
				<div class="step" data-step="16">
					<section class="text-box">
						<p>However for other seeing your long term progress can give you a <span class="green-text">better understanding of how your habits</span> may have improved or where long held bad habits may decrease your long term health or quality of living.</p>
					</section>
				</div>
				<div class="step" data-step="17">
					<h2>Health Literacy</h2>
					<section class="text-box">
						<p>Many users focus on collecting data without fully understanding how to interpret it. Without adequate health literacy, insights <span class="pink-text">may be misinterpreted</span>, leading to misguided health decisions. For instance, Samsung Health tracks stress levels based on heart rate variability (HRV) and heart rate (HR). While some studies link HR and HRV to emotional states, the definition of stress remains ambiguous. Does riding a roller coaster elevate stress levels even if the experience is enjoyable? With many of the explanations of the data shown hidden away, users may draw <span class="pink-text">incorrect conclusions</span> from their data and make unnecessary adjustments (11).</p>
