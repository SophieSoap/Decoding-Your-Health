# Decoding-Your-Health
This website was created as part of the course Deconstructing User Interfaces, led by Francesca Morini, during the winter semester 2024/25 at the University of Applied Sciences Potsdam. Our project critically explored and investigated deceptive patterns in UX/UI design, specifically how user interfaces can subtly shape and influence the user’s decisions and behaviours.

Focusing on the Samsung Health app, we examined its extensive usage of data visualisation and how those impact the user’s perception of their own personal health.
